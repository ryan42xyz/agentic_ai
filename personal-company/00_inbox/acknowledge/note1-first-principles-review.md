## Assumption Ledger

| Assumption | Category | Why believed | If false, then… | How to test | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| "三十岁" is a meaningful boundary requiring systematic change | Human | Cultural convention, life stage transition | No special action needed; incremental improvement sufficient | Compare outcomes of systematic vs incremental approach over 1 year | Medium |
| "资产负债表" model applies to personal/family context | Economics | Business analogy | Personal wealth requires different mental model | Test if balance sheet format yields actionable insights vs. simple cash flow tracking | Medium-High |
| "期权" (options) can systematically expand asset scale | Economics | Financial theory | Options may be too risky or not accessible; focus should be on core assets | Track option ROI vs. core asset growth over 6 months | Low-Medium |
| "Skills 既然能够限制，那么现在怎么做事情了？" implies skills are current bottleneck | Human/Compute | Self-assessment | Skills may not be limiting factor; other constraints (time, capital, network) matter more | Audit: what failed attempts were skill-limited vs. resource-limited? | Low |

## Fundamental Constraints

### Physics
- **Time**: 24 hours/day, finite lifespan; cannot be created, only allocated
- **Energy**: Physical and mental energy are finite and depletable
- **Reliability**: Human systems have failure modes; redundancy required

### Information
- **Observability**: Cannot fully observe own attention allocation without measurement tools
- **Delay**: Feedback loops for financial/knowledge systems have multi-month delays
- **Bandwidth**: Information processing capacity is limited (cognitive load)
- **Noise**: Social media algorithms inject noise into information diet
- **Information asymmetry**: Market knowledge gaps; personal blind spots

### Compute
- **Cognitive capacity**: Limited working memory, decision fatigue
- **Tool overhead**: AI agents require setup, maintenance, learning curve
- **Cost curve**: Diminishing returns on tool complexity vs. value

### Humans
- **Motivation**: Willpower is depletable; systems must reduce friction
- **Identity needs**: Social belonging and recognition are fundamental (cannot eliminate, only redirect)
- **Behavioral bias**: Present bias, loss aversion, status quo bias
- **Skill distribution**: Current skills constrain what's immediately achievable
- **Trust/coordination**: Family decision-making requires alignment (two-person scenario)

### Economics
- **Cash flow**: Income must exceed expenses for sustainability
- **Marginal cost**: Each additional system/tool has setup and maintenance cost
- **Opportunity cost**: Time/attention spent on one system cannot be spent on another
- **Switching cost**: Changing systems/tools has transition friction
- **Network effects**: Some systems (knowledge, social) benefit from network effects

### Legal/Policy
- (Not explicitly relevant in this context)

### Org/Process
- **Communication channels**: Family coordination requires clear protocols
- **Ownership**: Personal vs. family system boundaries need definition
- **Measurement**: Without metrics, cannot validate if systems are working

## Rebuilt Model / Decision Logic

### Core Tension
The document attempts to optimize multiple domains (finance, knowledge, attention) simultaneously, but they have different time horizons, feedback loops, and success metrics. The fundamental question: **Is this one unified "compound-interest system" or multiple independent systems that compound separately?**

### Rebuilt Structure

**Option A: Unified Compound System (Current Implicit Model)**
- **Mechanism**: One integrated system where financial stability → enables knowledge investment → enables AI agent leverage → reduces attention waste → compounds back to financial growth
- **Hard constraints satisfied**: Time allocation, energy management
- **Sacrifices**: Optimization depth in any single domain
- **Main risk**: System complexity exceeds management capacity; feedback loops too long to validate

**Option B: Independent Compound Systems (Modular Model)**
- **Mechanism**: Separate, independently measurable systems:
  - Financial: Cash flow tracking → asset allocation → option strategy
  - Knowledge: Input curation → processing system → application validation
  - Attention: Consumption audit → friction design → measurement
- **Hard constraints satisfied**: Each system has clear metrics and short feedback loops
- **Sacrifices**: Potential synergies between systems
- **Main risk**: Systems may conflict (e.g., knowledge investment vs. cash flow)

**Option C: Sequential Compound System (Phased Model)**
- **Mechanism**: Build systems in order of fastest feedback:
  1. Attention capital (weekly feedback) → immediate time/energy gain
  2. Cash flow (monthly feedback) → financial stability
  3. Knowledge system (quarterly feedback) → compound learning
  4. AI agent (6-month feedback) → leverage multiplier
- **Hard constraints satisfied**: Each phase validates before next investment
- **Sacrifices**: Delayed benefits from later systems
- **Main risk**: Life circumstances change before full system is built

### Recommended Approach: **Option C (Sequential) with Option B metrics**

**Rationale**: 
- Attention capital has shortest feedback loop (can measure impact in days/weeks)
- Financial stability is prerequisite for other investments
- Knowledge system requires stable foundation to compound
- AI agents are highest risk/highest reward; should be built on validated foundation

**Decision Logic**:
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Attention capital audit + minimal friction design
   - Measure: Hours saved per week, subjective well-being
   - Success: 5+ hours/week reclaimed, no decrease in life satisfaction
2. **Phase 2 (Months 3-4)**: Cash flow system + family decision model
   - Measure: Monthly cash flow, decision latency, family alignment
   - Success: Positive cash flow, <24h decision time for routine choices
3. **Phase 3 (Months 5-7)**: Knowledge system (input → process → apply)
   - Measure: Knowledge application rate (can you use learned concepts in novel situations?)
   - Success: 30%+ of "learned" knowledge applied within 3 months
4. **Phase 4 (Months 8-12)**: AI agent infrastructure (if Phases 1-3 validated)
   - Measure: ROI (time/cost saved vs. value generated)
   - Success: Positive ROI within 3 months of deployment

## Next Experiments

### Experiment 1: Attention Capital Baseline (Week 1)
- **Action**: Log all attention allocation for 7 days (15-min blocks)
- **Metrics**: 
  - Hours on social apps
  - Hours on "identity-seeking" consumption (comments, validation-seeking)
  - Hours on productive work
  - Subjective well-being (1-10 scale, daily)
- **Success criteria**: Baseline established; identify top 3 attention sinks
- **Failure criteria**: Cannot complete logging (too burdensome) → need simpler measurement

### Experiment 2: Financial System Minimal Viable Product (Month 1)
- **Action**: Build minimal balance sheet (assets, liabilities, cash flow) + one decision rule
- **Metrics**:
  - Time to update balance sheet (target: <30 min/week)
  - Decision rule application rate (target: 80%+ of applicable decisions use rule)
  - Cash flow accuracy (target: <5% variance from actual)
- **Success criteria**: System is usable and provides actionable insights
- **Failure criteria**: Takes >1 hour/week to maintain → simplify or abandon

### Experiment 3: Knowledge Internalization Test (Month 2, parallel to Exp 2)
- **Action**: Take one concept from current learning, attempt to apply in novel context, measure success
- **Metrics**:
  - Application attempt rate (target: 1 novel application per week)
  - Application success rate (target: 50%+ of attempts yield useful results)
- **Success criteria**: Can reliably internalize and apply knowledge
- **Failure criteria**: <30% success rate → knowledge system needs redesign

## Mind-Changers

### Information that would reverse conclusions:

1. **If attention capital reduction decreases life satisfaction by >20%**: 
   - **Then**: Attention "waste" may serve essential psychological needs; focus on redirecting rather than eliminating
   - **Update**: Design for attention quality (curated sources) rather than quantity reduction

2. **If financial balance sheet takes >2 hours/week to maintain**:
   - **Then**: System is too complex for personal context; financial management should be simpler
   - **Update**: Use cash flow tracking only, abandon balance sheet model

3. **If AI agent ROI is negative after 3 months**:
   - **Then**: AI agents are not ready for personal productivity use case
   - **Update**: Defer AI agent investment; focus on manual systems that compound

4. **If "skills" are not the limiting factor (from audit)**:
   - **Then**: Current bottleneck is elsewhere (capital, network, time allocation)
   - **Update**: Redirect skill development resources to actual bottleneck

5. **If knowledge cannot be reliably applied in novel contexts (<30% success rate)**:
   - **Then**: "Internalization" model is flawed; knowledge may be context-dependent
   - **Update**: Shift from "internalize" to "index and retrieve" model (external knowledge system)

6. **If family decision model creates more friction than it removes**:
   - **Then**: Decision model is over-engineered for current family complexity
   - **Update**: Simplify to 2-3 key decision rules, abandon comprehensive model

### Key Uncertainties to Resolve:

- **What is the actual current bottleneck?** (skills vs. capital vs. time vs. network)
- **Can attention capital be measured reliably without creating measurement burden?**
- **Is "compound-interest system" a valid mental model, or are domains too independent?**
- **What is the minimum viable financial system that provides actionable insights?**
- **Can AI agents provide positive ROI for personal productivity, or are they still in experimental phase?**

---

## Summary

The note attempts to build a unified "compound-interest system" across finance, knowledge, and attention, but this may be over-optimizing. The first-principles analysis suggests:

1. **Sequential rather than parallel construction** (fastest feedback first)
2. **Independent metrics for each domain** (avoid false unification)
3. **Validate assumptions before scaling** (especially AI agent ROI, attention capital measurability)
4. **Explicitly test if "skills" are the bottleneck** (may be red herring)

The core insight: **The system should compound, but the construction should be validated incrementally.** Start with attention capital (fastest feedback), then financial stability (foundation), then knowledge (compound learning), then AI agents (leverage multiplier) — but only if earlier phases validate.
