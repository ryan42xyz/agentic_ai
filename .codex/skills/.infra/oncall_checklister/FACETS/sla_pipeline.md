# SLA Pipeline

## Purpose

Inspect SLA metrics for batch and realtime pipelines.

## Scope

- Pipeline execution metrics
- SLA compliance rates
- Batch job status and durations
- Realtime processing latencies

## Inspection Checklist

1. SLA batch and realtime dashboard
   - Pipeline execution status
   - SLA compliance over time
   - Batch job success/failure rates
   - Realtime processing latency

2. Pipeline-specific metrics
   - Job durations and schedules
   - Processing volumes
   - Error rates per pipeline

3. Time window analysis
   - Compare current window to baseline
   - Identify degradation patterns
   - Correlate with other facets

## Principles

- SLA metrics reflect end-to-end health
- Distinguish batch vs realtime issues
- Consider pipeline dependencies
- Do NOT assume pipeline is root cause without correlation
