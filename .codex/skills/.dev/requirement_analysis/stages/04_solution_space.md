# Stage 04 — Solution Space (Solution Space Framing, No Commitment)

## Objective

Explore **solution space shapes**, NOT solutions.

This stage exists to:
- avoid premature commitment
- expose irreversible decisions

## Instructions

Describe 2–4 solution *patterns* or *approaches*:

For each:
- What does this approach optimize for?
- What does it sacrifice?
- What decisions become irreversible?

## Output

- High-level approach comparison
- Explicit irreversible decision points

## Forbidden

- No concrete APIs
- No code
- No recommendation of a "best" option
