# Stage 02 — Problem Space (Problem Space Classification)

## Objective

Classify the nature of the problem BEFORE thinking about solutions.

This stage answers:
- What type of problem is this?
- What dimension is the complexity coming from?

## Classification Axes

Analyze along these axes (mark unknown if unclear):

- Problem Type
  - New capability
  - Existing capability extension
  - Refactor / cleanup
  - Operational / workflow issue

- Complexity Source
  - State complexity
  - Process complexity
  - Data/model complexity
  - Organizational complexity

- Temporal Nature
  - One-off
  - Repeated pattern
  - Platform / long-term abstraction

## Output

- Classification + justification
- Explicit "cannot determine" where applicable

## Forbidden

- No solution discussion
- No implementation speculation
