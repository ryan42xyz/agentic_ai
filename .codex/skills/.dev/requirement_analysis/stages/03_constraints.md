# Stage 03 — Constraints (Constraint Surfacing)

## Objective

Make all constraints explicit and distinguish
**real constraints** from **assumed constraints**.

## Constraint Categories

For each constraint, label clearly:

### 1. Declared Constraints
Explicitly stated in the requirement.

### 2. Implied Constraints
Strongly suggested but not explicitly stated.

### 3. Organizational Constraints
Team, ownership, release, permission, or process limits.

### 4. Potential Pseudo-Constraints
Things that appear fixed but may be negotiable.

## Output

- List constraints by category
- Mark constraints worth challenging
- Identify constraints that block progress if unchanged

## Forbidden

- No workaround design
- No optimization
- No prioritization
