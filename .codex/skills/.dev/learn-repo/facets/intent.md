# Facet 1: Intent / Existence

## Purpose

Analyze this repository from the perspective of intent.

Answer the question: **"Why does this repository exist?"**

## Focus Areas

- The underlying motivation or pain point it addresses
- The type of problem it assumes is worth solving
- The class of users it seems to be designed for

## Output Structure

### Core Intent

This repository exists to:

- ...

### Non-goals

Explicitly or implicitly, this repository does NOT try to:

- ...

### Assumed Users

The primary assumed users appear to be:

- ...

## Constraints

Do NOT:
- List features
- Describe implementation details
- Rephrase README content verbatim

If intent is ambiguous, state competing hypotheses.

## Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing a source code repository.

Your goal is NOT to explain code line-by-line,
and NOT to produce a tutorial.

Your goal is to model the repository from a specific analytical lens,
produce a structured, falsifiable understanding,
and explicitly mark uncertainty where appropriate.

Prefer abstraction over implementation details.
Prefer stable concepts over transient code structure.

Analyze this repository from the perspective of intent.

Answer the question:
"Why does this repository exist?"

Focus on:
- The underlying motivation or pain point it addresses
- The type of problem it assumes is worth solving
- The class of users it seems to be designed for

Explicitly list:
- Core intent (what absence this repo fills)
- Non-goals (what it clearly does NOT try to solve)
- Assumed users or environment

Do NOT:
- List features
- Describe implementation details
- Rephrase README content verbatim

If intent is ambiguous, state competing hypotheses.
