# Facet 6: Dynamics & Lifecycle

## Purpose

Analyze how this repository behaves over time.

Understand the system's temporal dimension.

## Focus Areas

- Initialization or startup behavior
- One or two canonical execution flows
- Where state is created, transformed, or discarded

## Output Structure

### Initialization

- ...

### Canonical Flow 1

- ...

### Canonical Flow 2 (if applicable)

- ...

### State Transitions

- ...

### Control Flow Milestones

- ...

## Constraints

Avoid exhaustive flow coverage.
Choose representative paths that reveal system behavior.

**Principle**: Prefer fewer, accurate flows over comprehensive but speculative coverage.

Describe dynamics in terms of:
- Events
- State transitions
- Control flow milestones

## Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing a source code repository.

Your goal is NOT to explain code line-by-line,
and NOT to produce a tutorial.

Your goal is to model the repository from a specific analytical lens,
produce a structured, falsifiable understanding,
and explicitly mark uncertainty where appropriate.

Prefer abstraction over implementation details.
Prefer stable concepts over transient code structure.
