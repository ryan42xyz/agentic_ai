# Facet 9: Comparative Positioning (Optional)

## Purpose

Position this repository relative to similar systems or known patterns.

Place the repository in your cognitive coordinate system.

## Focus Areas

- What this repository resembles
- What it intentionally diverges from
- Where it sits in the design space

## Output Structure

### Similar Systems

This repository resembles:

- ...

### Intentional Divergences

This repository intentionally differs from:

- ...

### Design Space Position

Where it sits in the design space:

- ...

### Applicable Scenarios

- ...

## Constraints

Use comparisons to clarify intent and scope,
not to evaluate superiority.

If no clear comparison exists, state that explicitly.

## Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing a source code repository.

Your goal is NOT to explain code line-by-line,
and NOT to produce a tutorial.

Your goal is to model the repository from a specific analytical lens,
produce a structured, falsifiable understanding,
and explicitly mark uncertainty where appropriate.

Prefer abstraction over implementation details.
Prefer stable concepts over transient code structure.

Position this repository relative to similar systems or known patterns.

Compare:
- What this repository resembles
- What it intentionally diverges from
- Where it sits in the design space

Use comparisons to clarify intent and scope,
not to evaluate superiority.

If no clear comparison exists, state that explicitly.
