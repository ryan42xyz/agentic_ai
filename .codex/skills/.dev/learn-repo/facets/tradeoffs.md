# Facet 8: Trade-offs

## Purpose

Analyze the trade-offs made by this repository.

Understand the system's value orientation.

## Focus Areas

- What the system optimizes for
- What it deprioritizes or sacrifices
- Tensions between flexibility, performance, safety, and simplicity

## Output Structure

### Optimization Priorities

The system optimizes for:

- ...

### Deprioritized Aspects

The system sacrifices or deprioritizes:

- ...

### Tensions

Tensions between competing goals:

- ...

### Inferred vs Explicit

If trade-offs are inferred rather than explicit, label them as such:

- ...

## Constraints

Focus on decisions visible in structure or abstraction choices,
not micro-optimizations.

If trade-offs are inferred rather than explicit, label them as such.

## Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing a source code repository.

Your goal is NOT to explain code line-by-line,
and NOT to produce a tutorial.

Your goal is to model the repository from a specific analytical lens,
produce a structured, falsifiable understanding,
and explicitly mark uncertainty where appropriate.

Prefer abstraction over implementation details.
Prefer stable concepts over transient code structure.
