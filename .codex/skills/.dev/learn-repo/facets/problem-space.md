# Facet 2: Problem Space

## Purpose

Analyze how this repository conceptualizes its problem space.

Focus on the problem framing, not the solution.

## Focus Areas

- How the problem is framed or abstracted
- What dimensions of the real-world problem are simplified or ignored
- What assumptions are taken for granted

## Output Structure

### Problem Abstraction

The repository frames the problem as:

- ...

### Simplifications

The following real-world complexities are simplified or ignored:

- ...

### Implicit Assumptions

The repository assumes:

- ...

### Implicit Constraints

- ...

### Hidden Assumptions

- ...

## Constraints

Do NOT:
- Explain how the solution works
- Discuss specific technologies unless they reveal assumptions

If multiple problem framings seem possible, list them.

## Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing a source code repository.

Your goal is NOT to explain code line-by-line,
and NOT to produce a tutorial.

Your goal is to model the repository from a specific analytical lens,
produce a structured, falsifiable understanding,
and explicitly mark uncertainty where appropriate.

Prefer abstraction over implementation details.
Prefer stable concepts over transient code structure.

---

Analyze how this repository conceptualizes its problem space.

Focus on:
- How the problem is framed or abstracted
- What dimensions of the real-world problem are simplified or ignored
- What assumptions are taken for granted

Identify:
- Implicit constraints
- Hidden assumptions
- Simplifications that shape the solution

Do NOT:
- Explain how the solution works
- Discuss specific technologies unless they reveal assumptions

If multiple problem framings seem possible, list them.
