# Facet 5: Structural Skeleton

## Purpose

Analyze the structural decomposition of this repository.

Describe the system's skeleton, not its directory tree.

## Focus Areas

- High-level modules or subsystems
- Control vs data vs glue responsibilities
- Extension points or customization surfaces

## Output Structure

### High-Level Modules

- **Module A**
  - Responsibility:
  - Type: (control / data / glue)

- **Module B**
  - Responsibility:
  - Type: (control / data / glue)

### Extension Points

- ...

### Control Flow

- ...

## Constraints

Do NOT:
- Enumerate files or folders exhaustively
- Mirror the repository tree structure

Prefer a conceptual structural view over a physical one.

## Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing a source code repository.

Your goal is NOT to explain code line-by-line,
and NOT to produce a tutorial.

Your goal is to model the repository from a specific analytical lens,
produce a structured, falsifiable understanding,
and explicitly mark uncertainty where appropriate.

Prefer abstraction over implementation details.
Prefer stable concepts over transient code structure.

Analyze the structural decomposition of this repository.

Your goal is to describe the system's skeleton, not its directory tree.

Identify:
- High-level modules or subsystems
- Control vs data vs glue responsibilities
- Extension points or customization surfaces

Do NOT:
- Enumerate files or folders exhaustively
- Mirror the repository tree structure

Prefer a conceptual structural view over a physical one.
