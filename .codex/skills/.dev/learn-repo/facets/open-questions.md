# Facet 10: Open Questions / Uncertainty

## Purpose

List unresolved questions and uncertainties about this repository.

Treat uncertainty as a first-class output to prevent cognitive illusions.

## Focus Areas

- Areas where understanding is incomplete
- Assumptions that require validation
- Hypotheses that could be wrong

## Output Structure

### Incomplete Understanding

Areas where understanding is incomplete:

- ...

### Unvalidated Assumptions

Assumptions that require validation:

- ...

### Hypotheses

Hypotheses that could be wrong:

- ...

### Evidence Needed

What evidence would reduce uncertainty:

- ...

## Constraints

Do NOT attempt to resolve these questions.
Treat uncertainty as a first-class output.

Optionally suggest what evidence would reduce uncertainty.

This facet serves as the skill's safety valve.

## Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing a source code repository.

Your goal is NOT to explain code line-by-line,
and NOT to produce a tutorial.

Your goal is to model the repository from a specific analytical lens,
produce a structured, falsifiable understanding,
and explicitly mark uncertainty where appropriate.

Prefer abstraction over implementation details.
Prefer stable concepts over transient code structure.
