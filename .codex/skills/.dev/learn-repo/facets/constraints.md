# Facet 7: Constraints & Reality

## Purpose

Analyze signs of real-world constraints shaping this repository.

Understand why the code looks the way it does.

## Focus Areas

- Defensive or workaround-heavy code
- Historical artifacts or backward compatibility patterns
- Design decisions that prioritize safety over elegance

## Output Structure

### Defensive Patterns

- ...

### Historical Artifacts

- ...

### Workarounds

- ...

### Safety-First Decisions

- ...

### Inferred Pressures

What pressures (technical or organizational) are implied:

- ...

## Constraints

Avoid judging quality.
Describe constraints neutrally and infer cautiously.

Focus on:
- Why the system might look this way
- What pressures (technical or organizational) are implied

This facet reveals the most "human" layer of the repository.

## Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing a source code repository.

Your goal is NOT to explain code line-by-line,
and NOT to produce a tutorial.

Your goal is to model the repository from a specific analytical lens,
produce a structured, falsifiable understanding,
and explicitly mark uncertainty where appropriate.

Prefer abstraction over implementation details.
Prefer stable concepts over transient code structure.
