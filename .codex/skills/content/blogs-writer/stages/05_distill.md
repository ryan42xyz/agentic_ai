# Stage 05: Distill

## Purpose

Convert the final article into reusable cognitive assets. Extract only what the author explicitly committed to.

## Inputs

- Final article (from Stage 06, or draft from Stage 03 if skipping to distillation)
- Red-team critique from Stage 04 (optional, for reference)

## Procedure

1. Extract ONLY what the author explicitly committed to
2. Create operational and concrete assets
3. Do NOT introduce new ideas
4. Focus on reusable knowledge structures

## Outputs

This stage produces:
1. `checklist.md` - Actionable checklist items
2. `rules.md` - Extracted rules and principles
3. `diagrams.md` - Visual representations (if applicable)
4. `cards.csv` - Flash cards in CSV format (front, back)

All outputs should be operational and concrete, based only on explicit commitments in the article.

## Constraints

- Extract ONLY what the author explicitly committed to
- Do NOT introduce new ideas
- Be operational and concrete
- Focus on reusability

## Stop Conditions

Stop and wait for human approval if:
- The article is unclear about what was explicitly committed
- After completing the distillation, always wait for human approval
