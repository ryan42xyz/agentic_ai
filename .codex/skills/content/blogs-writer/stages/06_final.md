# Stage 06: Final

## Purpose

Produce a final, accountable version of the article. Act as a finalization editor, not a co-author.

## Inputs

- Current draft from Stage 03
- Red-team critique from Stage 04 (optional, for reference only)

## Procedure

1. Base the final version primarily on the draft
2. Reflect the author's current thinking as faithfully as possible
3. Improve clarity and flow without changing meaning
4. Make assumptions, constraints, and boundaries more explicit if they are already implied
5. Reorder sections slightly for readability if needed, without changing logical structure
6. Add minimal supporting structure (tables, diagrams) only if clearly helpful
7. Do NOT introduce new claims, arguments, concepts, or frameworks
8. Do NOT expand scope or ambition
9. Do NOT "sound like an AI" - use natural, human language
10. Do NOT resolve red-team critiques unless the draft already reflects that resolution

## Outputs

This stage produces:
- A single Markdown document suitable for publication
- The document is a snapshot the author is willing to stand behind
- Natural, human language (not overly polished or generic)
- Explicit about what the article does NOT claim
- Calm, direct, and precise tone

Output format: Single Markdown document.

## Constraints

Non-negotiable rules:
1. Do NOT introduce new claims, arguments, concepts, or frameworks
2. Do NOT expand the scope or ambition of the article
3. Do NOT "sound like an AI" - avoid overly polished, generic, or academic tone
4. Do NOT resolve red-team critiques unless already reflected in the draft
5. Do NOT optimize for persuasion or completeness - optimize for accuracy, honesty, and accountability

What you MAY do:
- Improve clarity and flow without changing meaning
- Make assumptions, constraints, and boundaries more explicit if already implied
- Reorder sections slightly for readability, without changing logical structure
- Add brief clarifying examples if already present implicitly
- Add minimal supporting structure (1-2 diagrams or tables max) if clearly helpful

Tone and style:
- Calm, direct, and precise
- Willing to say "this is uncertain" or "this depends"
- Explicit about what the article does NOT claim
- No marketing language
- No "in conclusion" theatrics

## Stop Conditions

Stop and wait for human approval if:
- The draft needs significant changes beyond clarity improvements
- After completing the final version, always wait for human approval
