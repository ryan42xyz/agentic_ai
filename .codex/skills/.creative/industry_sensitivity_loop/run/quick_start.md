# Quick start (10–30 min)

## When to run

- A surprising launch, pricing move, regulation, capability jump, or customer behavior shift.
- A persistent discomfort that you can’t explain.

## Steps

1. Stage 01: write one falsifiable judgment (no sources)
   - Follow: `../stages/01_direction.md`
2. Put it into state (one active hypothesis)
   - Update: `../state/active_hypothesis.md`
3. Stage 02: generate 3–7 attack questions and try to break it
   - Follow: `../stages/02_validation.md`
4. Stage 03: time-boxed fast input to answer those questions only
   - Follow: `../stages/03_fast_input.md`
5. Update state
   - Set `Status` to `active`, `weakened`, or `invalidated`
   - Update `Last Updated` and `Next Expected Signal`
