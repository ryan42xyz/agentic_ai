# Stage 02 — Validation (反证引擎 / adversarial)

This stage is not “learning”; it is attacking Stage 01’s judgment.

## Precondition

- You already have a one-sentence falsifiable judgment in `../state/active_hypothesis.md`.

## Input

- The current judgment + the event that triggered this loop run.

## Output

- 3–7 validation questions that could falsify the judgment.
- For each question, define what evidence would count as “supports” vs “weakens/invalidates”.

## Examples (question styles)

- “Is this already consensus?”
- “Are there real users paying for it?”
- “Is this research-only / demo-only?”
- “What’s the bottleneck: data, distribution, cost, regulation, trust?”
- “What would disconfirm this in 90 days?”

## Rules

- Question-driven only (no browsing without questions).
- Time-boxed (default: 10–20 minutes to produce questions; separate time-box for Stage 03).
- Every question must map back to the judgment (no curiosity drift).
